New features
------------

* The bundled HDF5 library in pre-built packages is updated to 1.14.5

  * This introduces a regression on Windows: filenames for HDF5 files can only
    contain characters from the current system code page. If you need full unicode
    support for filenames, you may want to use the previous h5py release, or get
    packages with an older HDF5 version from another source (such as conda-forge).
